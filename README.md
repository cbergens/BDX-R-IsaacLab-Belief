# BDX-R: A Journey in Bipedal Robotic Locomotion

This repository chronicles the development of BDX-R, a personal endeavor to create a bipedal robot inspired by Disney's BDX droids. The primary goal is to achieve stable walking and successfully bridge the simulation-to-reality (Sim2Real) gap using reinforcement learning.

## 🎯 Current Focus: Walking and Sim2Real

The project is currently in its initial phase, with the core focus on mastering bipedal locomotion. The immediate objectives are:

-   **Achieve Stable Walking:** Train a robust walking policy using reinforcement learning.
-   **Cross the Sim2Real Gap:** Successfully transfer the policy trained in a simulated environment to the physical robot.

*At this stage, the project is concentrated on the fundamental mechanics of the body's movement. Expressiveness and the integration of a head are future goals to be explored after mastering stable locomotion.*

## 🛠️ Hardware

The BDX-R is built with a focus on high-performance components that are accessible to the robotics community. The entire build is being developed with a target budget under **$3,000**.

-   **Robstride Motors:** These motors provide the necessary torque and precision for dynamic and controlled leg movements.
-   **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano:** Serving as the onboard computer, the Jetson Orin Nano has the computational power required to run the trained RL policy in real-time.

## 🤖 Software and Training: Reinforcement Learning with Isaac Lab

The robot's ability to walk is being developed through reinforcement learning within the **NVIDIA Isaac Lab** simulation environment.

A policy is trained in this virtual space, allowing the BDX-R to learn and adapt its movements to maintain balance and achieve forward motion. This process is critical for developing a robust control system before deploying it on the physical hardware.
